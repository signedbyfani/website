## Overview

Mobility aids such as crutches are essential for many individuals with physical disabilities. However, existing crutch tips often present challenges, including poor stability, discomfort, and susceptibility to wear and tear. Our team undertook the challenge of redesigning crutch tips to improve safety, durability, and user comfort.

**Design for Accessibility:** M. Des Semester 2

**Team:** Fanindra Maharana (me), Anmol Jhanwar, Pulak Tambi, Shubham Raghav

## Understanding the Problem

#### Challenges Identified

- Slipping hazards, especially on wet surfaces
- stability and durability issues
- Difficulty maneuvering on different terrains
- Crutch tip breakage, exposing the metal tube
- Discomfort and excessive pressure on hands and underarms
- Skin irritation and wrist pain

Through extensive research, including user interviews and daily activity observations, we determined that an improved crutch tip would significantly enhance user experience without requiring a complete redesign of the crutch itself.

## Ideation

#### Our approach involved:

- Studying existing crutch tip designs and their limitations
- Conducting user interviews to gather firsthand experiences
- Sketching initial design concepts
- Exploring multiple material and form options

For Material selection, we explored properties like Durability, Slip, Abrasion, UV & Weather Resistance, Shock Absorption. After careful evaluation, we chose Silicone Rubber for its superior slip resistance, shock absorption, and durability.

#### Concepts Sketching

## 3D Modelling

After finalising the concept, we proceeded with 3D modelling. This step involved creating a detailed 3D model of the crutch tip, ensuring it accurately represented the desired design.

## Conclusion and Impact

#### Final Design Features

- Enhanced grip pattern to reduce slipping risks
- Shock-absorbing material for increased comfort
- Durable composition to withstand various terrains
- Universal fit for compatibility with different crutch types

Additionally, we identified a knowledge gap in crutch maintenance among users. As a solution, we developed a user manual providing maintenance guidelines to extend product longevity.

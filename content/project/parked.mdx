## Overview of this personal project

This case study focuses on addressing the challenges faced by employees working in big cities, such as unorganized parking systems and time-consuming searches. The solution entails a mobile app designed to optimize employees' parking experiences by improving parking efficiency, enhancing user convenience, and providing real-time parking information.

## Understanding the problem

Based on my primary research, I've made two user personas.

### Defining the problems

Based on the my primary research, I found three primary issues to be addressed.

- Employees **struggle to find empty parking spots during busy hours**. This causes delays, frustration, and reduced productivity.
- **Unauthorized parking**, whether by employees or visitors, worsens the shortage of designated parking spaces for employees.
- Additionally, the **frequent use of car alarms** in parking lots creates excessive noise in the vicinity of the office area.


## Ideation and Design Process
By fulfiling the following **project goals**, we can address the primary concerns

- Streamline payment and financial operational
- Ensure accurate accounting and financial record
- Reduce invoice amount dispute

### Digital Wireframes
Before diving into crafting polished designs, I've rapidly brainstormed some sleek, low-fidelity wireframes to lay the groundwork.
